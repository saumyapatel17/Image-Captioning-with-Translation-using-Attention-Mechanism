# Image-Captioning-with-Translation-using-Attention-Mechanism
Automatic Image captioning suggests that the generation of a caption
for a picture by a machine. Image captioning is performed by feting objects, attributes and
affiliation between them. During this paper, we tend to introduce associate degree accommodative attention encoderdecoder frame which may mechanically decide once to calculate on visual signals and once to only calculate on the language model. Of course, once hoping on visual signals, the model
additionally decides wherever – that image region – it ought to attend to. In such a frame for
image captioning, a picture is initial decoded to a collection of purpose vectors via a CNN
grounded network associate degreed additionally decrypted to words via an RNN grounded
network, wherever the eye medium attendants the decipherment method by generating a
weighted traditional over the uprooted purpose vectors for every time step.
